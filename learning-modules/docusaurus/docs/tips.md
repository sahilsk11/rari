### 1. Read *all* instructions.

Self-explanatory. Don't skip steps or instructions!
 

### 2. NEVER feel forced to work on Rari.

If you ever feel that you are being forced to work on the project, stop right away. The goal of this project is for you to explore the fun and creative applications of computer science. That magic is torn away when you feel that you HAVE TO do it. We want you to love the work that you do!

### 3. Ask for help!

The Rari team is accessible whenever you want us to be. If you're even slightly confused, reach out.
