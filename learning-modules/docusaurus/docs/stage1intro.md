Welcome to the first programming module!

## Objectives
Stage 1 will be using [Google Vision APIs](https://cloud.google.com/vision/) to recognize objects in front of our vehicle, and then deciding whether to move forward or not. By the end, your vehicle will move forward and stop when it detects a stop sign ahead!

## Stuff you will learn
- What an API is and how to use it
- Controlling the vehicle
- HTML requests
- Loops in Python

### Note

Since this is the first module, there will be a learning curve to understanding how this all pieces together. If you are stuck at any point, the Rari Team is always here to help you out!

### Let's go!
